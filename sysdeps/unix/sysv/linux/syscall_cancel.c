#warning "This implementation should be use just as reference or for bootstrapping"

/* This is the generic version of the cancellable syscall code which
   adds the label guards (__syscall_cancel_arch_{start,end}) used
   on SIGCANCEL sigcancel_handler (nptl-init.c) to check if the cancelled
   syscall have side-effects that need to be signaled to program.

   This implementation should be used a reference one to document the
   implementation constraints: the __syscall_cancel_arch_end should point
   to the immediate next instruction after the syscall one.  This is because
   kernel will signal interrupted syscall with side effects by setting
   the signal frame program counter (on the ucontext_t third argument from
   SA_SIGINFO signal handler) right after the syscall instruction.

   If the INTERNAL_SYSCALL_NCS macro use more instructions to get the
   error condition from kernel (as for powerpc and sparc), uses an
   out of the line helper (as for ARM thumb), or uses a kernel helper
   gate (as for i686 or ia64) the architecture should adjust the
   macro or provide a custom __syscall_cancel_arch implementation.   */
